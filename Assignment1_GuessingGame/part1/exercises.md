1. In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses could it take to get the right number if we had no hint at all? Explain.
2. In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses does it take to get the right number if we get a hint of 'higher or lower' when guessing numbers 1-10? *Hint* In your answer show this mathematically with the [log function](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/logarithms.html).

## Answers

1. 10 times, e.g. random number is 10, user guess from 1 to 10
2. 4 times, always put the mediem number of the range. log(2,10) ~ 4 times
