# Exercises

Discuss and answer the following questions (Make sure to elaborate and justify your responses):

1. What does it mean if a binary search tree is a 'balanced tree'?
2. What is the Big-O search time for a balanced binary search tree? (You may assume the binary tree is perfectly balanced and full).
3. Now think about a binary search tree in general, and that it is basically a linked list with up to two paths from each node. Could a binary search tree ever exhibit an O(n) worse-case search time? Explain why or why not. It may be helpful to think of an example of operations that could exhibit worse-case behavior if you believe so.
4. What is the recurrence relation for a binary search?
	- Note: Your answer should be in the form of: T(N) = aT(N/b) + f(n) (i.e. determine what 'a' 'b' and 'f(n)' are).

## Answers

1. A balanced tree means: (1) its absolute difference of heights of left and right subtrees at any node is less than 1. (2) For each node, its left subtree is a balanced binary tree. (3) For each node, its right subtree is a balanced binary tree.
2. O(log(n))
6. Yes, it could. In worset-case, a binary search tree degenerate to a linked list. When searching a key, we have to check the key against the key of every node, therefore its time complexity of a search is O(n).
7. T(N) = T(N/2) + O(1)

A bit ago a student asked me about this course, CS 5800, and other courses and how they may prepare you for interviews. I was recently talking to a Google, now Microsoft Engineer who told me that the reality is having a lot of LeetCode practice will help. LeetCode is a website to practice solving algorithmic challenges.

Let's finish off this exercise with a small C programming sample.

###

Solve the following: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

**Copy and paste your code into** a file in this directory called [challenge.c](./challenge.c) that solves the following problem.

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
* Note: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 100
* All the values in the tree are unique.
* root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.

### Example 1

> Input: root = [1,0,2]
>
> Output: [3,3,2]

### Example 2

> Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
> 
> Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

### Example 3

> Input: root = [0,null,1]
> 
> Output: [1,null,1]
